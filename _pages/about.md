Hello! I'm Weihan, a second-year MSCS student at Duke University. My research aims to **enhance human capability** through creative tasks such as music composition and **increase knowledge accessibility**. I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Cynthia Rudin on **interpretable music generation** and with Dr. Pardis Emami-Naeini on **human-AI interaction**. I am currently collaborating with Dr. Julian McAuley, Dr. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, and Dr. Hao-Wen Dong on **content creation**. My recent projects include **controllable music generation** and **documentary teaser generation**. I also receive valuable advice from Dr. Shlomo Dubnov on music generation and from Dr. Paul Liang on multimodal learning. Previously, I earned my undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan, where I worked with Dr. Sardar Ansari and Dr. Kayvan Najarian on **time series data processing**. Additionally, I collaborated with Dr. Gongjun Xu to apply statistical analysis to education assessment data.
